## How to work with ${kw} — five steps

1. **Pick one small action you can repeat daily.**
2. **Anchor it to an existing routine (habit stacking).**
3. **Log for seven days before changing another variable.**
4. **Review weekly patterns, not hourly scores.**
5. **Consult a clinician for persistent or acute symptoms.**

## Limits and responsible use

Wellness apps highlight habits and patterns. They do not diagnose, treat, or cure disease. No app can guarantee health outcomes. CheckApp is a wellness companion, not a medical device.
